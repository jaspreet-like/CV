        <h2>Hello.</h2>
        <p class="txt">I am a final year student at IIT Kanpur pursuing major in Mathematics and Scientific Computing. I have recently developed interest in Competitive
          Programming and Web Development. Apart from it, I'm very much inclined towards sports, in particular soccer. I love making out unplanned adventure
          trips. If you are like-minded and want to escapade someday, count me in! Kudos :)</p>

          <h3>Programming</h3>
          <p>I started programming about 4 months ago. Till now, I'm confident with most of Web Development tools like HTML, CSS, Bootstrap etc. Apart from it,
            I also like taking part in competitive programming contests which mainly includes problems from Data Structures. I'm currently looking
            towards starting on a project around Web Development. If you want to have a website for your organisation/startup, feel free to contact me.
            We are a team of 4 like-minded friends who will commit towards understanding the essence of your project and express it impactfully in
            digital and print.</p>

          <h3>Soccer</h3>
          <p>I started playing soccer at the age of 13 in my school. Almost instantly, I was in love with the game. By 16, I had played in local tournaments
            and as well as college sports fests. Between 16-18, I had a break of 2 years for my academic commitments. I resumed playing in my college under
            the guidance of my coach Mr. Sunil Kumar. Our college team participated in numerous tournaments, most competitive among it being Inter-IIT Sports
            Meet. Now, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, I'm back to my hometown Patiala. If you live nearby and are interested in playing soccer matches, feel
            free to contact me.</p>
