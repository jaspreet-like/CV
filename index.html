        <h2>Hello.</h2>
        <p class="txt">I am a pre-final year student at <strong>IIT Kanpur</strong> pursuing integrated B.S-M.S in <strong>Mathematics and Scientific Computing.</strong> My technical 
          skill set includes <strong>Competitive Programming, Web Development</strong> and <strong>Machine Learning.</strong> Apart from it, I'm very much inclined towards sports, in particular soccer. 
          I love going out on unplanned adventure trips. If you are like-minded and want to escapade someday, count me in! Kudos :)</p>

          <h3>Programming</h3>
          <p>I started programming about a year ago. Till now, I'm confident in some Machine Learning techniques particularly, Monte Carlo Simulations and 
            optimizations, some Data Analysis like regression models and some basic Web Development tools like HTML, CSS, Bootstrap etc. Apart from it,
            I also like taking part in programming contests which mainly includes problems from Data Structures. I've done coding in various languages 
            which includes C, C++, Python, R, Matlab/Octave. I'm also interested in Image processing using numpy and cv2 modules and have also done a project on this. 
            If you want to get hands-on/do some project on any of the mentioned topics above or any realted fields, feel free to contact me:)

          <h3>Soccer</h3>
          <p>I started playing soccer at the age of 13 in my school. Almost instantly, I was in love with the game. By 16, I had played in local tournaments
            and as well as college sports fests. Between 16-18, I had a break of 2 years for my academic commitments. I resumed playing in my college under
            the guidance of my coach Mr. Sunil Kumar. Our college team participated in numerous tournaments, most competitive among it being Inter-IIT Sports
            Meet. Now, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, I'm back to my hometown Patiala. If you live nearby and are interested in playing soccer matches, feel
            free to contact me.</p>
